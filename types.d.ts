/* This is a type declaration file.

Type declarations in a d.ts file are by default accesible globally in a TS project.

These cease to be type declaration files if the import/export keywords are used. That means types here would not be automatically accessible to the TS service

In a case where symbols are exported/imported, the file will act as a common module
and other .ts files will have to import these individually to access them.
